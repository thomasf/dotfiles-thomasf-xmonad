! Let's do this:
!  - Use Caps lock as Control
!  - Use Left Control as Mod4 (the key usually known as the windows key)
!
! My reasons:
!  - The caps lock function is not needed, it's legacy functionality.
!  - The caps lock key's position is a better location for control.
!  - I've started to use an IBM model M keyboard
!    again which does not have a windows/super key.

! The method below may seem a bit strange, reference:
! https://www.libreoffice.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35317#c14

! left control -> mod4
remove control = Control_L
add mod4 = Control_L

! caps lock -> control
remove lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = ISO_Level5_Shift
add control = ISO_Level5_Shift
